There are 5 directories to distinguish major operation to run ACAC program.

**1.Generate-AlloyCatalysts  
*Usage: ./gen_TOTAL_AB.sh
Necessary Files: 
	INPUT_A_LIST: The alloy's first atom element names are written.
	INPUT_B_LIST: The alloy's second atom element names are written.
	
Output Files: 
	ALLOY_LIST_TABLE: Two alloy's atom element symbols are written as line by line.
	TOTAL_AB: Two alloy's atom element symbols and structure names are written as line by line.
(Structure Type: FCC, CsCl, NaCl, Wurtzite, Zinc blende, HCP, B33, B19, B11, B27, L11)

*Usage: ./gen_compound ATOM_INFO TOTAL_AB
Input Files:
	ATOM_INFO: the atomic information such as atomic number, symbol, name, radius, etc
	TOTAL_AB: comes from "gen_TOTAL_AB.sh"

Output Files:
	COMPOUNDS_LIST: includes alloy's atomic symbol, structure type, structure index, lattice parameters (a,b,c)


**2.Auto-ab.inito.Calculation  
*Usage: ./genInput.sh: generate "qsub.sh" for the purpose of queue submission
Necessary File:
	COMPOUNDS_LIST: comes from "1.Generate-AlloyCatalysts/"
	gen_POSCAR: generate POSCAR file
	gen_POTCAR.sh: generate POTCAR file
	INPUT/: includes INCAR, KPOINTS files

Output File:
	qsub.sh: queue submission script file

*Optional:  	
	divideFile.sh: divide "COMPOUNDS_LIST" file to allow pararell process in order to save running time linearly.
                   output COMPOUNDS_LIST.xx (xx means the index of division) 


**3.Postprocess  
*Usage./screenSuccess.sh: After finishing all ab-inito calculation(in our case, VASP software), just collect succeeded alloys 
                    for the calculation by checking string remark in "OUTCAR" file
Necessary File:
	../OUTCARDir/: This is the directory that consists of all finished OUTCAR files for alloy's ab-inito calculation

Output File:
	1.SUCCESS_AB: only two alloy's atom element symbols and structure name about succeeded calculation


*Usage: ./screenFail.sh: After the collection of succeeded files, just collect failed alloys except the succeeded alloys
Necessary File:
	1.SUCCESS_AB: come from "screenSuccess.sh"

Intermediate File:
	2. TOTAL_AB

Output File:
	3.FAIL_AB: only two alloy's atom element symbols and structure name about failed calculation

*Usage: ./screenTime.sh: After finishing all ab-inito calculation, print used running time
Necessary File:
	../OUTCARDir/: This is the directory that consists of all finished OUTCAR files for alloy's ab-inito calculation

Output File:
	0.USER_TIME: include used time(sec) at first column

**4.Measure-DOSsimilarity  
*Usage: ./scriptEnergy.sh: print total energy of all alloy's systems from all output of the ab-inito calculation.
Necessary File: 
	1.SUCCESS_AB: come from "/Postprocess/"

Output File:
	TOT_Energy.out: include two alloy's atom element symbols,structure name, and total energy value

*Usage: ./scriptDOSsim.sh DOSCAR_BASE
Input File: 
	DOSCAR_BASE: the base DOSCAR file to compare another DOSCAR file

Necessary File:
	../DOSCARDir/: This is the directory that consists of all finished DOSCAR files for alloy's ab-inito calculation
	cal_DOS_sim.cc: This is the program to measure DOS similarity from two DOSCAR inputs

Output File:
	TOT_DOSsim.XX.out: include two alloy's atom element symbols,structure name, and DOS similarity value 
		XX means the file name of the base DOSCAR.

**5.Build-Alloy.Map
*Usage: ./build_alloy_map INPUT_A_LIST TOT_Energy.out TOT_Energy-HCP.out TOT_DOSsim.XX.out
Input File:
	INPUT_A_LIST: The alloy's first atom element names are written.
	TOT_Energy.out, TOT_Energy-HCP.out: come from "4.Measure-DOSsimilarity/"
	DOS_DOSsim.XX.out: come from "4.Measure-DOSsimilarity/"

Output Files:
	OUTFILE0.dat: print formation energy value about all structure types 

	OUTFILE1.dat: print the table of formation energy value about the most stable structure

	OUTFILE2.dat: print the table of structure type about the most stable structure
	
	OUTFILE3.dat: print the table of DOS similarity value (partial comparison of structure cases)

	OUTFILE4.dat: print the table of DOS similarity value about the most stable structure 

	OUTFILE5.dat: print the table of the range of DOS similarity values and count number of alloys to draw the histogram
